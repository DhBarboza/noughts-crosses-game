# noughts-crosses-game
"Tic-Tac-Toe," or "Noughts and Crosses," is a classic 2-player game of strategy. Played on a 3x3 grid, players take turns marking empty spaces with their symbols, usually "X" for player one and "O" for player two. The objective is to get three symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before the opponent.
